# Contributing
If you haven't already, come find us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/cEJzdnt). We would love to chat with you, and get you caught up with everything that has happened so far.

## Submitting Changes
To get started, fork this project. Then, visit our documentation for setting up both the [React App](/frontend/README.md) and our [backend API](/backend/README.md).


Please send a [pull request](https://github.com/ProgrammingBuddies/web-proj-price-tracker/compare?expand=1) with a clear list of changes that you have made, if there is an [open issue](https://github.com/ProgrammingBuddies/web-proj-price-tracker/issues) make sure to reference that in your comment.

* Make sure your code passes the ESLinter tests, as they will not be accepted if there are conflicts.
* Make sure all the commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

One-line messages are fine for small changes, but larger changes should have an accompanying paragraph describing what changed and the impact this change has.

## Important Note about ESLinter
We will add support for an ESLinter environment soonâ„¢.
