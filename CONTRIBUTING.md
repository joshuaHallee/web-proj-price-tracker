# How to Contribute
If you haven't already, come find us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/cEJzdnt).

## Submitting Changes
Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to ProgrammingBuddies](https://github.com/ProgrammingBuddies/web-proj-price-tracker/compare?expand=1) with a clear list of changes that you have made (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). Please use our coding conventions (below) and make sure all the commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

One-line messages are fine for small changes, but larger changes should have an accompanying paragraph describing what changed and the impact this change has.

## Coding Conventions
We will add support for an ESLinter environment soon.
