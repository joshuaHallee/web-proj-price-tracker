## Price Tracker
The best way to track and view product price histories from popular retail vendors such as Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon, and many more of your favorite places to shop.

This repo is for the [r/programmingbuddies](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingBuddies/) web project.

## Project Overview
This project is a full MERN stack application still in development. This means we are still accepting [pull requests](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Price Tracker seamlessly integrates two projects into one, both a frontend website as well as a custom web scraping API. This allows for a separations of concerns (SoC) design principle while developing this project.

## Getting Started
To get started, please visit our documentation for setting up both the [React App](/frontend/README.md) and our [backend API](/backend/README.md).

## Documentation
The official API documentation is available [on the Apiary.io platform](https://webprojpricetracker.docs.apiary.io/).
