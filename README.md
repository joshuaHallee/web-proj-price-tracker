# Web Project Price Tracker
This repo is for the r/programmingbuddies web project for an online price tracker. Per polls that took place in the discord, we've decided to use the MERN stack technologies:
* MongoDB for database
* Express for routing
* React for UI
* NodeJS for server

# Project Overview
There should be a main navigation that allows the user to see available categories. Such as appliances, clothing, office supplies, Etc.

When a specific category is chosen, it will return the results of all the products listed in the database. In this view, the user will be able to see the product name, description, price, and what store it is available at for purchase.

From this view users can also click on an item to be brought to a new page, which will return the item price history displayed in a chart.

This can change, but the current minimum viable product is:
* Users can browse item categories.
* Users can view items inside categories
* Users can view item price history
